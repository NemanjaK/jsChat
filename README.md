jsChat
======

jsChat is a small, lightweight HTML5 chat application. It's currently under development. Client-side uses Knockout, SocketIO, jQuery and implements Twitter Bootstrap HTML 5 Boilerplate. I've just started to work on this application so it's not yet usable at all. Putting it on GitHub is my way of learning since I will really appritiate any comments, feedbacks or support. Keep in mind I'm PHP/Python developer and this is my crash-course with rich HTML5 frontend application.
