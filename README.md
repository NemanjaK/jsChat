jsChat
======

jsChat is a small, lightweight HTML5 chat application. It's currently under development. Client-side uses Knockout, SocketIO, jQuery and implements Twitter Bootstrap HTML 5 Boilerplate.

I've just started to work on this application so it's not yet usable at all. Putting it on GitHub is my way of learning since I will really appreciate any comment, feedback or suggestion.

Since I'm PHP/Python developer with limited experience with client-side development, don't expect this to be "state of the art". I'm using this project to familiarize with client-side technologies and techniques.
